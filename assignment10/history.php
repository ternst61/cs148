        We know the Ernst family tree back to Friedrich Wilhelm Ernst and his
        wife Friedrika Wilhelmina Gerling (b. 1773)  He was a trumpeter in the 
        Prussian Army. The Ernst family was very musical from generation to 
        generation. The family came to the United States in the mid-1800's, settling 
        in New York City and New Jersey. Otto Ernst was the first to immigrate,
        in 1846. He was a clay merchant and an active trustee of the German 
        Savings Bank. For more on Otto Ernst, visit <a href="http://americanhistory.si.edu/steinwaydiary/annotations/?id=801" target="_blank">this page</a>
        containing information about him from the contents of William Steinway's
        diary.
